# Windows Window Manager

This repository contains a PowerShell script designed to close all active windows on a Windows operating system. 
It's especially useful when thereâ€™s no built-in option to close everything at once, and users want a quick way to terminate all active windows. 
The script can be run directly or added as a shortcut for easy access.
